# Customer Similarity, Purchase probability, and Data Protection through machine learning

## Objective
The insurance company Sure Tomorrow wants to solve several tasks with the help of machine learning and requests that this possibility be evaluated.

Task 1: Find customers who are similar to a given customer. This will help the company's agents with marketing.

Task 2: Predict whether a new customer is likely to receive an insurance benefit. Can a trained prediction model perform better than an untrained dummy model? Can it perform worse? Explain your answer.

Task 3: Predict the amount of insurance benefits a new customer is likely to receive using a linear regression model.

Task 4: Protect customer personal data without breaking the model from the previous task.

A data transformation algorithm needs to be developed that makes it difficult to recover personal information if the data falls into the wrong hands. This is called data masking or data obfuscation. However, the data must be protected in such a way that the quality of the machine learning models is not affected.
